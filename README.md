*This project focuses on performing **big data analysis using PySpark** to demonstrate how large datasets can be processed efficiently using distributed computing. The objective of the project was to analyze a high-volume sales dataset and extract meaningful insights that would not be feasible using traditional data processing tools. The dataset contained millions of records including product details, categories, quantities sold, prices, regions, and order dates. Using PySpark, the data was loaded into a Spark DataFrame, automatically distributed across multiple partitions, and processed in parallel, which ensured scalability and high performance.

During the project, Apache Spark’s PySpark framework was used along with Python in a Jupyter Notebook or Python script environment. The data was first cleaned by removing missing values, and new derived columns such as total sales were created to support better analysis. Various analytical operations were then performed using Spark DataFrame APIs and Spark SQL, including aggregation, grouping, and sorting. The analysis provided insights such as total revenue generated, category-wise sales performance, top-selling products based on quantity, region-wise revenue contribution, and monthly sales trends. These operations highlighted Spark’s ability to handle large datasets efficiently and perform complex computations in a distributed manner.

Through this project, I gained a strong understanding of big data concepts and hands-on experience with PySpark. I learned how distributed data processing works, how Spark manages large datasets using partitions, and how it outperforms traditional data analysis tools when working with massive data volumes. I also developed skills in data cleaning, feature creation, and analytical querying at scale. Overall, this project strengthened my knowledge of big data analytics and demonstrated practical skills that are relevant for real-world data engineering and analytics roles.
